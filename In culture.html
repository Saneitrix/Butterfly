            <h2>In art and literature</h2>
                <p>Butterflies have appeared in art from 3500 years ago in 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. In the ancient 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica">Mesoamerican</a> city of 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a>, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar">jaguar</a>, and some species were considered to be the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_civilisation">Aztec civilisation</a>; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_peoples">Zapotec</a> and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilisation">Maya civilisations</a>.</p>
                <p>Butterflies are widely used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, embedded in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings. The Norwegian naturalist 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjell_B._Sandved">Kjell Sandved</a> compiled a photographic 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_Alphabet">Butterfly Alphabet</a> containing all 26 letters and the numerals 0 to 9 from the wings of butterflies.</p>
                <p>Sir 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tenniel">John Tenniel</a> drew a famous illustration of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>, c. 1865. The caterpillar is seated on a toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image can be read as showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Carle">Eric Carle</a>'s children's book 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Very_Hungry_Caterpillar">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a> portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.</p>
                <p>A butterfly appeared in one of

                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madam_Butterfly">Madam Butterfly</a> is a 1904 opera by 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</a> about a romantic young Japanese bride who is deserted by her American officer husband soon after they are married. It was based on 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Luther_Long">John Luther Long</a>J's short story written in 1898.</p>
            <h2>In mythology and folklore</h2>
                <p>According to 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn">Lafcadio Hearn</a>, a butterfly was seen in Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen">omens</a>. When 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_no_Masakado">Taira no Masakado</a> was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened—thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.</p>
                <p>Diderot's 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die"><i>Encyclopédie</i></a> cites butterflies as a symbol for the soul. A Roman sculpture depicts a butterfly exiting the mouth of a dead man, representing the Roman belief that the soul leaves through the mouth. In line with this, the ancient Greek word for "butterfly" is ψυχή (psȳchē), which primarily means "soul" or "mind".According to 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a>, some of the Nagas of Manipur claim ancestry from a butterfly. In some cultures, butterflies symbolise rebirth. The butterfly is a symbol of being transgender, because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult. In the English county of Devon, people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year, to avoid a year of bad luck. In the Philippines, a lingering black or dark butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean an impending or recent death in the family. Several American states have chosen an

            <h2>Collecting, recording, and rearing</h2>
                <p>"Collecting" means preserving dead specimens, not keeping butterflies as pets. Collecting butterflies was once a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William_Frohawk">Frederick William Frohawk</a> succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, at a rate of four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.</p>
                <p>Butterflies and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth">moths</a> can be reared for recreation or for release.</p>
            <h2>In technology</h2>
                <p>Study of the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration">structural coloration</a> of the wing scales of swallowtail butterflies has led to the development of more efficient 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">light-emitting diodes</a>, and is inspiring 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a> research to produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and the development of new display technologies.</p>

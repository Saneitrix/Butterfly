        <h1>Butterfly</h1>
        <p> <b>Butterflies</b> are 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect">insects</a> in the macrolepidopteran clade 
            <i>Rhopalocera</i> from the order 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidoptera"><i>Lepidoptera</i></a>, which also includes 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth">moths</a>. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large superfamily 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilionoidea"><i>Papilionoidea</i></a>, which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "
            <i>Hesperioidea</i>"), and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "
            <i>Hedyloidea</i>"). Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, as like most insects they undergo
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holometabolism"></a>complete metamorphosis. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva">larvae</a>, known as 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar">caterpillars</a>, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa">pupate</a> in a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysalis">chrysalis</a>. When 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.</p>
        <p>Butterflies are often 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)">polymorphic</a>, and many species make use of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage">camouflage</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry">mimicry</a>, and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism">aposematism</a> to evade their predators. Some, like the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_(butterfly)">monarch</a> and the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_cardui">painted lady</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_migration"></a>migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite">parasites or 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid">parasitoids</a>, including 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid_wasp">wasps</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"></a>protozoans, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly">flies</a>, and other invertebrates, or are 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">preyed upon</a> by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., 
            <a>harvesters</a>) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)">mutualists</a> in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts. The 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> says "butterflies are certainly one of the most appealing creatures in nature".</p>
